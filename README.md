## Hi, I'm Isabella 😊👋🏻

I'm majoring in environmental science with a concentration in applied ecology, and I have a minor in information sciences and technology. I'm on track to complete a Professional Science Masters in geospatial technologies.

I’m interested in the connections between earth science, sustainability, and technology, especially finding ways to use geospatial tools and data-driven approaches to support environmental problem-solving. I’ve always loved rocks and minerals, and my geology and ecology classes helped shape how I understand the natural world and our responsibility to protect it.

I hope to build a career where I can make a meaningful impact, whether through environmental consulting, sustainability work, or applying technical skills to help communities and ecosystems. My HAZWOPER training is one small step toward being useful in real-world situations, and I’m excited to keep growing.

Fun fact: I have a drone flying license 🌻
